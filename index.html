                    <h3> Techbyte - Noroff Project Exam </h3>
                    <p> For our first year exam we were tasked with building a front end application for a blogpost
                        website, where you could choose / make up the client yourself. Here we would be handling and
                        building most of the website dynamically using a supplied API from noroff and javascript to
                        process the logic. Through a combination of localstorage, url key & value pairs, and lots more I
                        was able to build a pretty sleek and good looking blogging site that builds most things
                        dynamically in my ever so humble opinion. The site features the ability to log in to a user, to
                        register a user and also it will not let you edit / post or be on pages you're not allowed to
                        have access to if you are not logged in as an administrator / owner. This project has taught me
                        lots about handling of API's in general and how to use them in a practical setting, so should I
                        want to make something of the same sort later, I will now have something to refer to experience
                        from. All in all, very happy with how it turned out.</p>

                    <h3> Community Science Museum - Noroff Semester Project </h3>
                    <p> My Noroff semester project where our task was to make a webpage for a museum (we had not learnt
                        to use javascript at this time) that would appeal to kids between the ages 7-15. This was our
                        task: "The site should appeal to youngsters without pandering; while aiming at a younger
                        audience it should not patronise them with overtly childish themes. The core purpose of the site
                        is to excite and entice people to visit the museum." The whole purpose of the website is to act
                        more like information pamphlet with visuals and there is not a whole lot of functionality due to
                        the nature of not having javascript included aswell.

                        However I feel like it turned out great, I scored a 92/100 for the marking criteria and went
                        with a light design that was bright and colorful to inspire kids and youngsters.</p>

                    <h3> GameHub - Cross-Course Project </h3>
                    <p> This was our Cross-Course Project (Design, HTML & CSS) where we would implement what we had
                        learned from Design, HTML and CSS. We got the option of choosing between either RainyDays
                        (outside clothing website), GameHub (video game website) or SquareEyes (movie and film website).
                        I chose to go with GameHub, as it was what I felt the most connected to (being a gamer myself).
                        I took some inspiration from all the big name's in the market like steam, epic games and the
                        list goes on. Then I combined them into sort of like a hybrid of them all and I must say I'm
                        very pleased with the result. The problem I've felt with all of those mentioned above is that
                        either they are way too cluttered or there is way too little information to be found or you have
                        to navigate in a frustrating way to get where you want.

                        But to summarize, probably one of the designs I'm the most happy with during my first year at
                        noroff, as I am a sucker for minimalism and contrast.</p>
